          I’ve tried every diet and weight loss program out there. Nothing has
          workedlong term. How are you different?

          Your Certified Health Coach is an experienced dietitian. She has also
          maintained a substantial weight loss for many years. The secret to
          maintaining long term success is not found in a diet or restrictive
          food plan. Through her years as a dietitian, studying human behavior,
          and as a highly effective Certified Health Coach, she embraces these
          truths in her practice:


          *   Knowledge DOES NOT equal habit change


          *   Nobody wants to be told what to eat


          *   Diets DO NOT WORK long term


          *   97% of people who lose weight dieting, regain it within 6 months


          *   You can’t “out-exercise” poor eating habits


          *   It isn’t about just losing the weight… it’s about creating a life
          that you
              don’t have to escape from.

          *   Habits are driven by PLEASURE. So, the journey to better health
          must be
              pleasurable & fun, or it won’t stick!

          Here at Lake City Coaching, we understand your frustrations with the
          diet

          roller-coaster.


          > We have a better way!


          We use a fun, pleasant approach to achieve

          long term habit change.

          I can’t workout or go to the gym. Will that keep me from being
          successful?
        content: >
          No, that will not affect your success at Like City Coaching. Our
          program meets you where you are right now. Progressing through the
          program, you will naturally have more energy and less pain. As you
          feel better, you will probably want to get more active, and we support
          & encourage that. Your physical activity should be enjoyable and
          do-able. Something you look forward to. At LCC, we have no specific
          exercise requirements.
