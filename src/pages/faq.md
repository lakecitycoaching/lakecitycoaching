          I’ve tried every diet and weight loss program out there. Nothing has
          worked long term. How are you different?
        content: >
          Your Certified Health Coach is an experienced dietitian. She has also
          maintained a substantial weight loss for many years. The secret to
          maintaining long term success is not found in a diet or restrictive
          food plan. Through her years as a dietitian, studying human behavior,
          and as a highly effective Certified Health Coach, she embraces these
          truths in her practice:


          *   Knowledge DOES NOT equal habit change


          *   Nobody wants to be told what to eat


          *   Diets DO NOT WORK long term


          *   97% of people who lose weight dieting, regain it within 6 months


          *   You can’t “out-exercise” poor eating habits


          *   It isn’t about just losing the weight… it’s about creating a life
          that you
              don’t have to escape from.

          *   Habits are driven by PLEASURE. So, the journey to better health
          must be
              pleasurable & fun, or it won’t stick!

          Here at Lake City Coaching, we understand your frustrations with the
          diet

          roller-coaster.


          > We have a better way!


          We use a fun, pleasant approach to achieve

          long term habit change.

          I can’t workout or go to the gym. Will that keep me from being
          successful?
        content: >
          No, that will not affect your success at Like City Coaching. Our
          program meets you where you are right now. Progressing through the
          program, you will naturally have more energy and less pain. As you
          feel better, you will probably want to get more active, and we support
          & encourage that. Your physical activity should be enjoyable and
          do-able. Something you look forward to. At LCC, we have no specific
          exercise requirements.

        title: 'Do I need to buy special food, supplements, memberships, etc?'
        content: >
          No. There is nothing to purchase. We don’t sell anything.


          > Weird, huh?


          No special food, supplements, memberships, shots, no magic pills or
          “belly buster” drinks…..no “fat blasters”….nothing to buy!


          Our magic happens through pleasurable, easy, evidence- based habit
          change. We engage our clients in the joy of becoming the highest
          version of themselves. We know that our HABITS (not supplements) are
          the #1 determiners of the quality of our life.

        title: "Help! It seems like no matter how healthy I eat, how much I diet, I just can’t\_get the excess weight off. Especially the belly fat. Can you help me?"
        content: >
          Yes! Lake City Coaching can help you. I’ve been there. Skipping meals,
          eliminating entire food groups, working out until I drop, eating salad
          while others are having a “real” meal. Experiencing low energy most of
          the time and just generally feeling “tired of being tired!”



          ### Here’s the good news: 


          ## It’s likely not your fault. 


          There are many factors that contribute to weight gain (especially
          stubborn belly fat) that most people are

          unaware of. Many of these contributing factors actually happen during
          the “white knuckling” periods of self- deprivation. When we feel as if
          we have been attempting to “push string uphill”….. when we have tried
          our best, and worked so hard and it just doesn’t happen for us. Then,
          we can’t stand it anymore, fall off the wagon, gain a few more pounds
          and the toxic cycle begins all over again.



          If that scenario sounds familiar to you, we want to welcome you, and
          encourage you to stop doing the same old thing, and expecting
          different results. The truth is, if “different” results were going to
          happen, they would have happened a long time ago, right?



          We use fresh, enjoyable techniques that get results like nothing else!

          With fun, easy, evidence- based interventions and proven clinical
          strategies we

          engage our clients in life-long habit change. And, we make it fun!
