As an experienced Dietitian for a variety of Weight Loss Clinics & Health Clubs, I've learned that knowledge does not equal habit change.
Most of my adult life was lived on the roller coaster somewhere between obese and "crash dieting". I spent 7 years in a wheelchair as a result of obesity related conditions. I blew out both of my knees, and a hip (resulting in the need for 3 total joint replacements), suffered from arthritis, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, hernia, unstable blood sugar, acid-reflux, congestive heart failure, asthma, anxiety and depression.

### Today, I am grateful to be FREE from ALL of those conditions, and ALL of the medications I took to treat them. 

Yes, I went from a wheelchair to walking, hiking, playing on a trampoline, horseback riding, bicycle riding, swimming and occasionally even climbing a tree!

>
> What made the long term difference?

# &#xA;HABIT CHANGE.


Gentle, fun, pleasurable habit change.

>
> Deprivation?

### &#xA;No, thank you!


After joyfully regaining my health and energy, and successfully maintaining a 200 pound weight loss for many years, I decided to study and document the habits of the 3% of people (including myself) that actually MAINTAINED a substantial weight loss beyond 5 years. 

As a Certified Health Coach, I share my knowledge, experience & gentle Habit Change Techniques through my practice at Lake City Coaching.

# &#xA;You will receive private, one-on-one coaching with a program that gets lasting results!
