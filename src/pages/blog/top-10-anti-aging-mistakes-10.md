### How you drink your coffee, tea and wine

##### How this ages your look:

Your eyes may be the window to your soul, but your teeth are what others see when you talk or smile. We all know that the caffeine in tea and coffee is notorious for staining your once white tooth enamel and causing it to yellow. As we age, we are more prone to stains because of the amount of caffeine or red wine we consume and because of how we sip it.

##### What you can do to make a change:

###### STRAWBERRY WHITENING PASTE!

Be mindful when you drink coffee, tea or red wine not to swoosh it around on your teeth like a mouthwash because it stains the teeth. Another trick is to use a natural tooth-whitener containing malic acid found in strawberry! Mash one strawberry to a pulp and mix with half a teaspoon of baking powder. Use a toothbrush to coat your teeth with the mixture. Leave on for five minutes and then brush! Now, go out and flash those pearly whites!
