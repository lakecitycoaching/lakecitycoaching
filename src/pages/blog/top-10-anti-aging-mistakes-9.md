### Turning your nose up at smelly sulfur veggies

##### How this ages your skin: 

You know that stinky egg odor that rises up from mineral hot springs? That’s sulfur! And it’s actually really good for your skin. It’s the often- misunderstood “beauty mineral.” If your body lacks sulfur, your skin will look dull, your pores will clog up and your complexion will appear lackluster. Why? Sulfur provides smoothness and shine to your skin by helping with fat digestion and controlling the metabolism of carbohydrates. Sulfur also helps rid the body of waste. 

And…..it resists bacteria and protects against toxicity. Additionally, it helps restore connective tissue in the skin and maintain its structural integrity.

What you can do to make a change: 

> EAT THE STINKY VEGGIES! 

Think twice next time before turning your nose up at the cruciferous family of veggies in the produce section like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, turnips, bokchoy and kohlrabi. Add these to your diet and your skin will start to glow as though you’ve been soaking it up in mineral hot springs.
