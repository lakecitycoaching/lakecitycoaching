> We engage to uncover your greatest desires, and gain a clear understanding of what matters most. Then, we embark upon a fun, easy, evidenced based course to get you there. The path along the way becomes crystal clear and the steps toward the life you want come into laser focus, and then….your success becomes inevitable.

As a client, our Habit Change Coaching method will engage you in releasing the old destructive habits that have sapped your energy, dissolved your dreams, and left you with physical & emotional harm such as low energy, excess weight, stress & chronic illness.

### You will then discover how to identify & embrace pleasurable, energizing, healthy new habits to reset your energy & transform your health for life.

We already know that, with this program, success is inevitable, and of course, the results are great!

# But, did I mention that the process is fun?

The journey is the best part! Why? Because our HABITS are the #1 determiner of the quality of our life. And….Our HABITS are driven by pleasure. If it doesn’t feel good, it won’t stick!

*There are a few things that we DON’T DO:*

We don’t use diets, food plans, shots, pills, drinks, supplements or products of any type. There is nothing to buy. There are no exercise regiments or food restrictions. You won’t be required to record what you eat, or report what you weigh. There are no meetings or workshops to attend. There are no books to read or videos to watch. Just private, enjoyable, one-on-one weekly sessions with me.

### Above all, there is NO judgment! You will learn to replace judgment with playful curiosity, and to expand your capacity for joy & goodness to a whole new level during your journey!

# Diets & deprivation work great, right?…...….until they don’t!

Many of us have deprived ourselves of specific foods…..sometimes, entire food groups and experienced some (often rapid) and usually temporary weight loss. But then, when we just can’t do ONE MORE DAY of the “diet”, when the cravings for the “forbidden foods” kick in,….. we cave! Usually in a big way and often with disastrous results. As diets fail, we often experience:

*   Binge eating (and a “screw it all” mindset)

*   Regaining the weight we lost and then some extra

*   Self loathing

*   Feeling like a failure

*   Energy crash

*   Mood swings or Depression

Yet, we have continued to do the same things….We ”jump on” and “fall off” the diet roller coaster…... in search of the one magic diet, pill, supplement or quick fix that might have different results next time.

Then, once again, we rejoin the 97% of people who REGAIN their weight within 6 months of their weight loss. Yes! That is the sad statistic for weight loss success. And, usually, dieters end up regaining MORE weight than they initially lost.

Of course, I’m licensed and Certified to administer the programs, and to do the clinical work that I do. But….These clinical sessions are fueled with the experience of a coach that has walked the walk.

Yes, I have been there! That’s why I am doing this work.

Like me, YOU can be part of the 3% to:

*   Discover which behaviors are energy giving (and which are energy robbing)

*   Make peace with FOOD. Food is NOT the enemy

*   Learn how to eat intuitively and to enjoy meals without guilt

*   Experience activities and pleasures that you may have abandoned

*   Make yourself a priority, even with your busy lifestyle
