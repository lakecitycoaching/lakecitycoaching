### Eating too much sugar

##### How this ages your skin:

Experts now agree that eating processed sugar over a lifetime can lead to dull, wrinkled skin. Huh? Why would sugar speed up the aging process? Good question! A high-sugar diet reduces the quality of the collagen in your skin. How does this work? Your skin has three types of collagen (I, II, and III) and when it absorbs too much sugar, it weakens type III, which

is also the strongest and most durable collagen. This is what makes your skin look less supple, drier and more prone to wrinkles.

What you can do to make a change:

> SWITCH TO NATURAL UNPROCESSED SWEETENERS

If the thought of foregoing sugar altogether is giving you a nervous breakdown, relax… here are a few healthier alternatives so you don’t have to forever abandon your sweet tooth:

Maple syrup that is pure, unflavored and free of additives like high- fructose corn syrup

Raw honey that is unheated and unfiltered is rich in minerals and vitamins

Black strap molasses is high in iron and Vitamin B6

Date sugar is high in fiber, calcium, potassium and magnesium

Stevia and Monk fruit are wonderful sweeteners for weight control
