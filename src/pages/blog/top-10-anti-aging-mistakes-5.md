### Using a High PH or drying Body Wash

##### How this ages your body:

Washing your whole body from head to foot with generic bar soaps is often second nature. It’s what our grandmothers used to do right? But the problem is that generic bar soaps are manufactured using lots of harmful ingredients by companies out tomake a profit, not to protect your skin.

Bar soaps are usually worse culprits than liquid soaps when it comes to drying out your skin because they generally contain much higher pH levels.

##### What’s a pH level?

Good question! This is the first thing to look out for when choosing a soap that’s truly gentle and moisturizing for your skin. The symbol pH stand for “potential of hydrogen” which is a way of measuring the acid or alkaline levels of soaps.

##### In short this is how it works:

Your skin’s natural pH level is 5.5 and most brand name bar soaps have a pH of between 8 and 10, which is way too harsh and drying for your delicate skin! So much so that these soaps crack the skin making it more prone to harmful pathogens and bacteria. (Note that as each number increases the acidity is multiplied by ten! So, if you are using a soap with a pH of 6.5 that is making your skin feel too tight, it’s because it is drying out your skin tenfold!)

And don’t be fooled by advertisers labeling their soaps as “gentle,“natural” or “pure”... this is just marketing. So purchase soaps according to their pH levels of between 5 and 7 not because of the adjectives on the box. (Empty adjectives are just as bad for you as empty calories!)

What you can do to make a change:

> RAISE THE (SOAP) BAR!

Ditch the drying soap altogether and use one with a neutral pH (soaps with a pH of 7, or soaps with a balanced pH of 5). Household brand name bar soaps such as Ivory, Dial, Shield and Palmolive have a pH of 10 or more which is extremely caustic and damages the skin leading to all kinds of dermatological problems and premature aging so stay away from these!
