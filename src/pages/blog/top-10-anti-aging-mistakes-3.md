### Underestimating the value of heart- healthy fatty acids

How this ages your body: The older you get, the harder your body has to work to pump blood to your heart and brain because age slows down the body’s functioning and puts strain on your heart and immune system.

The Good News is that Omega-3’s found in fatty fish such as wild salmon, lake trout, sardines, mackerel and tuna (anchovies & sardines, too!) are nature’s gift to anti-aging! Here’s why….. Omega-3’s are known to significantly reduce inflammation in the body, which is a symptom of most chronic age-related diseases. For example, Omega-3 supplements are known to lower triglycerides (blood fat) levels that can otherwise put you at risk for heart disease. And, some research suggests that Omega-3’s even protect against Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Aside from eating fatty fish, what is the best way to get Omega-3 fatty acids?

What you can do to make a change: TAKE FISH OIL If the thought of eating sardines out of the can turns your stomach, the next best thing is omega-3 fish oil capsules! These are one of the BEST ways to keep your skin healthy and supple, and they support your heart and immune functions as you age. According to Dr Mark Hyman, New York Times bestselling author and founder of the Ultra Wellness Center, finding a high quality fish oil is imperative. So look out for reputable brands that certify that their products are heavy metal and pesticide free!

Dr Hyman recommends taking 1000 mg of fish oil twice daily with a 300/200 ratio of EPA/DHA. These are both long-chain Omega-3fatty acids which are found in most fish and shellfish and in algae and seaweed. \*Fish are not able to produce EPA & DHA. They get it from eating algae & seaweed.
