Mistake # 2 

Getting too much sun exposure without protection

How this ages your body: It is common knowledge that ultraviolet (UV) rays are harmful to your skin because they damage skin fibers called elastin, which makes your skin stretch, sag & wrinkle

What you can do to make a change: THINK SUN KISSED NOT SUN DRIED! Vitamin D is vital for our gut, bones and blood. So go out in the sun and enjoy, but if youâ€™re going to be in the sun between 10 AM-2 PM for longer than 20 minutes, wear sun protective hats/clothing, or a natural, chemical free sunscreen.
