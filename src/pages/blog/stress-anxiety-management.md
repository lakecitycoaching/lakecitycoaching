## Have you been living with chronic Stress and Anxiety?

### Here are some health conditions associated with stress:

*   **Increased cortisol production:** Associated with weight gain (especially in the belly), inability
    to lose weight or gain muscle, and premature aging.
*   **Decreased nutrient absorption:** Due to decreased digestive enzyme production; decreased bile
    flow from the gallbladder, as well as decreased oxygenation and gastrointestinal blood flow.
*   **Increased nutrient excretion:** Stress increases the urinary excretion of calcium; magnesium;
    potassium; zinc; chromium; selenium; and various trace minerals.
*   **Decreased gut flora populations:** Stress destroys healthy intestinal bacteria, which can lead to
    immune problems, skin disorders, nutrient deficiencies, and digestive distress.
*   **Increase in sodium and fluid retention:** Can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension).
*   **Decrease in thermic efficiency:** Ability to burn calories is diminished.
*   **Decrease in thyroid hormone:** Can decrease the body's metabolic activity.
*   **Increase in blood cholesterol:** Stress raises LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.
*   **Increase in blood platelet aggregation:** A major risk factor in heart disease.
*   **Decrease in sex hormones:** Can lower sex drive, energy, and decrease muscle mass.
*   **Increase in inflammation:** The basis of many ailments including brain and heart disease.
*   **Decrease in gastric emptying time:** Can lead to constipation and can be a risk factor in
    diseases of the colon.
*   **Increase in gastric emptying time:** Can lead to diarrhea, and food particles prematurely entering
    the small intestines—a probable factor in food sensitivities, and various disease conditions.
*   **Increased food sensitivities:** Most likely due to decreased immunity and leaky gut.
*   **Decreased Hydrochloric acid production:** The majority of people will experience a
    reduction of stomach acid in the presence of stress as the nervous system diverts blood flow away
    from digestive organs.
*   **Decrease in growth hormone:** A key hormone in growing, healing and rebuilding tissues; helps burn
    fat and build muscle.
*   **Increase in insulin resistance:** Chronic low-level stress may cause target cells to become
    unresponsive to insulin—a factor in diabetes, weight gain, heart disease and aging.
