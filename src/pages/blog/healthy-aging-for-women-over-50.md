## The Bad News

> Half of all adult women over 50 in the United States have at least one
> chronic disease, and 25 percent of us have two or more!

Additionally, Over half of us are
overweight. Chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension are
among the most preventable conditions, yet they are the leading cause of disability &
death in women over 50!

### To live a long, active, joyful, healthy life, Chronic Disease must be&#xA;managed with lifestyle changes.

That doesn’t mean trying to mask and manage symptoms
of the disease with bottles of prescription pills!

## The Good News

This is FIXABLE!

> If you want to live a longer, happier, more active life,
> you can!

### YES. YOU. CAN!

As an experienced & highly effective Certified Health Coach,
I help my clients adopt and sustain pleasurable, healthy new behaviors which become new
HABITS for life. Our HABITS are the #1 determiners of the quality of our life!.... Not
heredity, not luck, not a “diagnosis”, not where we live.... **It’s our HABITS.**

I’ve been there. I spent years in a wheelchair, and using a walker & a cane. I lived with pain
and took several prescription pills to try to relieve the symptoms caused by lifestyle
related chronic diseases. Now, after many years of being free from all of the chronic
diseases, the excess weight, and all those PILLS, I am helping other women over 50 learn
do the same.
