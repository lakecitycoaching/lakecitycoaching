      As an experienced Dietitian for a variety of Weight Loss Clinics & Health
      Clubs, I've learned that knowledge does not equal habit change.

      Most of my adult life was lived on the roller coaster somewhere between
      obese and "crash dieting". I spent 7 years in a wheelchair as a result of
      obesity related conditions. I blew out both of my knees, and a hip
      (resulting in the need for 3 total joint replacements), suffered from
      arthritis, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, hernia,
      unstable blood sugar, acid-reflux, congestive heart failure, asthma,
      anxiety and depression.

      ### Today, I am grateful to be FREE from ALL of those conditions, and ALL
      of the medications I took to treat them.


      Yes, I went from a wheelchair to walking, hiking, playing on a trampoline,
      horseback riding, bicycle riding, swimming and occasionally even climbing
      a tree!


      > What made the long term difference?


      # &#xA;HABIT CHANGE.


      Gentle, fun, pleasurable habit change.


      > Deprivation?


      ### &#xA;No, thank you!


      After joyfully regaining my health and energy, and successfully
      maintaining a 200 pound weight loss for many years, I decided to study and
      document the habits of the 3% of people (including myself) that actually
      MAINTAINED a substantial weight loss beyond 5 years.


      As a Certified Health Coach, I share my knowledge, experience & gentle
      Habit Change Techniques through my practice at Lake City Coaching.


      # &#xA;You will receive private, one-on-one coaching with a program that
      gets lasting results!
