### Ignoring your hands and neck in your beauty routine

##### How this ages your skin:

Nobody looks forward to getting a turkey neck later in life or hands that look like chicken feet!

Your hands and neck get even more sun exposure than your face does yet we often neglect them in our beauty routine or wash them with regular, drying soap with high pH levels to remove germs. What if you treated your hands and neck with the same care and attention as you do your face?

##### What you can do to make a change:

> LOVE UP YOUR HANDS AND NECK

Use the same exfoliating scrub, cleanser and moisturizer on your hands and neck as you do on your face. Protect them from prolonged sun exposure, and put coconut oil on your hands. (Coconut oil has a natural sun protection element to it, makes skin feel soft and subtle, and it’s very inexpensive.
