# Do you even remember what you ate?

> Why is it important to be mindful of what, when & how we’re eating anyway?

### Good question!

In today’s world we eat for convenience rather than for nutrition. We eat for instant gratification rather than long-term health benefits.

#### Have you ever gone out to dinner because you were “bored” and didn’t know what else to do?

I can help you to learn to eat mindfully and enjoy your food more! I can help you to see the food you eat as medicine that not only nourishes your whole system, infuses you with ENERGY, but also tastes delicious!

# So what is mindful eating?

Mindful eating means taking the time to honor your food by choosing high quality, organic food, preparing it with care and using all of your senses to enjoy it fully!

### Food is NOT the enemy!

It means allocating quiet time to prepare and enjoy eating your meal without rushing or multitasking at the same time. Mindful eating is a way of saying to yourself:

> I respect my body enough to be mindful of what I put into it and enjoy what I eat.

Think of this type of eating as a joyful meditation. It means choosing to be present with your food and the way you eat it. To really appreciate it.

My clients find that eating mindfully helps to: 

*   Know when you are full (not stuffed)

*   Get more satisfaction from eating

*   Build a healthy relationship with food

*   Improve digestion (less gas and bloating)

*   Regulate elimination

*   Discover food sensitivities

*   Create healthy habits that boost your energy levels

> How will I know if it’s time for me to learn to eat mindfully?

### Glad you asked!

It’s time for you to learn more about mindful eating if you answer “YES” to any of these questions:

*   You get bloated after eating

*   You gain weight easily (especially in your belly)

*   You eat so fast that you don’t have a clue how much you just consumed

*   You eat to numb out

*   You have extra pounds that just won’t budge with diet and exercise

*   You crave sugar or starchy foods

*   You have difficulty focusing or foggy brain

*   You feel lethargic after eating

*   You have allergies or hay fever

*   You eat foods that aren’t healthy for you but you just can’t stop

> What do I do now?

In my health coaching practice here at Lake City Coaching, I help clients discover what triggers them to overeat. Then I lead them through a step-by-step process to learn how to eat mindfully and to learn what to eat for their unique body type.

## Diets don’t work.

If you answered “YES” to any of the symptoms above, then contact us to schedule a time to talk with me about how you can learn to eat mindfully.

It’s one of the main habits that has allowed me to maintain a 200 pound weight loss for nearly a decade!

I’ll help you understand what’s blocking you from eating mindfully and I’ll show you how to get started.

### This is YOUR time!
