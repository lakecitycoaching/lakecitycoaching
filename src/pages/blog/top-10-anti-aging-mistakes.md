As a health coach, I've had many of my friends & clients say that I have “aged in reverse” over the past 10 years. It’s true! In many ways, I have. I weigh half of what I did a decade ago, and not only do I no longer need a wheelchair, cane or walker to ambulate, I’m an active woman who loves a variety of outdoor activities such as swimming, hiking, trampoline, biking and just being a “kid” again. In addition….Now, as a Certified Health Coach and experienced Dietitian, I get to show women in their 50’s, 60’s and 70’s how to look and feel fabulous, so they can be active and live life to the fullest without surgeries, crazy diets or pills.

### We are bombarded daily with expensive products and diets that promise “fat busting, energy soaring, fountain of youth, skinny making” miracles.

Most of us know that so much of what we read or hear out there is empty hype, right? The GOOD NEWS is, that there are natural, fun & healthy ways to avoid the anti-aging mistakes that so many of us make! Before I share the Top 10 anti-aging mistakes that I see my health coaching clients make, let’s take a quick look at this truth…...

### HOW you age actually has more to do with your LIFESTYLE choices than your genetics.

Yup! It’s true…..Our HABITS are the biggest determiners of the Quality of our Life! Experts agree that although your genes do play a role, almost 90% of HOW you age is actually due to external or extrinsic factors like over-exposure to sun, smoking, toxic food choices, sedentary lifestyles and even pollution.

What this means for you is that you have way more CONTROL over how you age than you thought you did! YES!! With that in mind, let’s dive into my Top 10 mistakes to avoid so you can start taking control over the aging process and feel Fabulous over 50, Sexy at 60 and Sensational at 70! Here we go….

# Mistake # 1 Trying to hydrate with sodas, coffee drinks and energy drinks:

How these drinks age your body: As we age, our bodies literally dry up from the inside out. Our skin just can’t continue to retain moisture like it did back in the day when we were plump infants with flesh that stored water easily. Did you know that a newborn baby is 75% water? Diet sodas, coffee drinks, and energy drinks may quench your thirst, but they don’t hydrate your system like water does...Why? Because they are jam packed with artificial flavors, sugars, chemical preservatives and acidifying agents that can lead to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and a lowered immune system.

What you can do to make a change: DRINK WATER, DRINK WATER, DRINK WATER. Drinking water is the true fountain of youth! It is all your body needs to stay hydrated.

How much water should you drink? A good rule of thumb is to drink HALF your body weight in ounces of water per day. \*For example, if your body weight is 150 pounds, then you need to drink about 75 ounces of water per day to stay optimally hydrated.
