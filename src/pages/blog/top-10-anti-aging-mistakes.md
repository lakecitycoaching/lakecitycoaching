As a health coach, I've had many of my friends & clients say that I have “aged in reverse” over the past 10 years. It’s true! In many ways, I have. I weigh half of what I did a decade ago, and not only do I no longer need a wheelchair, cane or walker to ambulate, I’m an active woman who loves a variety of outdoor activities such as swimming, hiking, trampoline, biking and just being a “kid” again. In addition….Now, as a Certified Health Coach and experienced Dietitian, I get to show women in their 50’s, 60’s and 70’s how to look and feel fabulous, so they can be active and live life to the fullest without surgeries, crazy diets or pills.

### We are bombarded daily with expensive products and diets that promise “fat busting, energy soaring, fountain of youth, skinny making” miracles.

Most of us know that so much of what we read or hear out there is empty hype, right? The GOOD NEWS is, that there are natural, fun & healthy ways to avoid the anti-aging mistakes that so many of us make! Before I share the Top 10 anti-aging mistakes that I see my health coaching clients make, let’s take a quick look at this truth…...

### HOW you age actually has more to do with your LIFESTYLE choices than your genetics.

Yup! It’s true…..Our HABITS are the biggest determiners of the Quality of our Life! Experts agree that although your genes do play a role, almost 90% of HOW you age is actually due to external or extrinsic factors like over-exposure to sun, smoking, toxic food choices, sedentary lifestyles and even pollution.

What this means for you is that you have way more CONTROL over how you age than you thought you did! YES!! With that in mind, let’s dive into my Top 10 mistakes to avoid so you can start taking control over the aging process and feel Fabulous over 50, Sexy at 60 and Sensational at 70! Here we go….

# Mistake # 1 Trying to hydrate with sodas, coffee drinks and energy drinks:

How these drinks age your body: As we age, our bodies literally dry up from the inside out. Our skin just can’t continue to retain moisture like it did back in the day when we were plump infants with flesh that stored water easily. Did you know that a newborn baby is 75% water? Diet sodas, coffee drinks, and energy drinks may quench your thirst, but they don’t hydrate your system like water does...Why? Because they are jam packed with artificial flavors, sugars, chemical preservatives and acidifying agents that can lead to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and a lowered immune system.

What you can do to make a change: DRINK WATER, DRINK WATER, DRINK WATER. Drinking water is the true fountain of youth! It is all your body needs to stay hydrated.

How much water should you drink? A good rule of thumb is to drink HALF your body weight in ounces of water per day. \*For example, if your body weight is 150 pounds, then you need to drink about 75 ounces of water per day to stay optimally hydrated.

# Mistake # 2 Getting too much sun exposure without protection

How this ages your body: It is common knowledge that ultraviolet (UV) rays are harmful to your skin because they damage skin fibers called elastin, which makes your skin stretch, sag & wrinkle

What you can do to make a change: THINK SUN KISSED NOT SUN DRIED! Vitamin D is vital for our gut, bones and blood. So go out in the sun and enjoy, but if you’re going to be in the sun between 10 AM-2 PM for longer than 20 minutes, wear sun protective hats/clothing, or a natural, chemical free sunscreen.

# Mistake # 3 Underestimating the value of heart- healthy fatty acids

How this ages your body: The older you get, the harder your body has to work to pump blood to your heart and brain because age slows down the body’s functioning and puts strain on your heart and immune system.

The Good News is that Omega-3’s found in fatty fish such as wild salmon, lake trout, sardines, mackerel and tuna (anchovies & sardines, too!) are nature’s gift to anti-aging! Here’s why….. Omega-3’s are known to significantly reduce inflammation in the body, which is a symptom of most chronic age-related diseases. For example, Omega-3 supplements are known to lower triglycerides (blood fat) levels that can otherwise put you at risk for heart disease. And, some research suggests that Omega-3’s even protect against Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Aside from eating fatty fish, what is the best way to get Omega-3 fatty acids?

What you can do to make a change: TAKE FISH OIL If the thought of eating sardines out of the can turns your stomach, the next best thing is omega-3 fish oil capsules! These are one of the BEST ways to keep your skin healthy and supple, and they support your heart and immune functions as you age. According to Dr Mark Hyman, New York Times bestselling author and founder of the Ultra Wellness Center, finding a high quality fish oil is imperative. So look out for reputable brands that certify that their products are heavy metal and pesticide free!

Dr Hyman recommends taking 1000 mg of fish oil twice daily with a 300/200 ratio of EPA/DHA. These are both long-chain Omega-3fatty acids which are found in most fish and shellfish and in algae and seaweed. \*Fish are not able to produce EPA & DHA. They get it from eating algae & seaweed.

# Mistake # 4 Caking on Foundation or powder

How this ages your skin: As you age you don’t want to be that woman who has slapped on so much foundation that you land up looking like a cadaver with makeup. Firstly, it looks like a bad cover up job and secondly, caking your face in foundation is really bad for your skin. Why? Most foundations are drying. They draw moisture from your skin and seep into fine lines and wrinkles, exaggerating them instead of concealing them. A lot of foundations also contain fragrances, chemicals and alcohol that can irritate your skin and remove its natural oils causing more wrinkles.

What you can do to make a change: CHANGE YOUR FOUNDATION….OR GO BARE! Let your skin breathe whenever you can!

Instead of foundation use a tinted moisturizer or translucent makeup especially if you are prone to dry skin. If you do need extra coverage, then use a good quality makeup brush to apply a tiny bit only to the areas, spots or patches that really need

# Mistake # 5 Using a High PH or drying Body Wash

How this ages your body: Washing your whole body from head to foot with generic bar soaps is often second nature. It’s what our grandmothers used to do right? But the problem is that generic bar soaps are manufactured using lots of harmful ingredients by companies out tomake a profit, not to protect your skin.

Bar soaps are usually worse culprits than liquid soaps when it comes to drying out your skin because they generally contain much higher pH levels. What’s a pH level? Good question! This is the first thing to look out for when choosing a soap that’s truly gentle and moisturizing for your skin. The symbol pH stand for “potential of hydrogen” which is a way of measuring the acid or alkaline levels of soaps. In short this is how it works: Your skin’s natural pH level is 5.5 and most brand name bar soaps have a pH of between 8 and 10, which is way too harsh and drying for your

delicate skin! So much so that these soaps crack the skin making it more prone to harmful pathogens and bacteria. (Note that as each number increases the acidity is multiplied by ten! So, if you are using a soap with a pH of 6.5 that is making your skin feel too tight, it’s because it is drying out your skin tenfold!) And don’t be fooled by advertisers labeling their soaps as “gentle,“natural” or “pure”... this is just marketing. So purchase soaps according to their pH levels of between 5 and 7 not because of the adjectives on the box. (Empty adjectives are just as bad for you as empty calories!)

What you can do to make a change: RAISE THE (SOAP) BAR! Ditch the drying soap altogether and use one with a neutral pH (soaps with a pH of 7, or soaps with a balanced pH of 5). Household brand name bar soaps such as Ivory, Dial, Shield and Palmolive have a pH of 10 or more which is extremely caustic and damages the skin leading to all kinds of dermatological problems and premature aging so stay away from these!

# Mistake # 6 Ignoring your hands and neck in your beauty routine

How this ages your skin: Nobody looks forward to getting a turkey neck later in life or hands that look like chicken feet!

Your hands and neck get even more sun exposure than your face does yet we often neglect them in our beauty routine or wash them with regular, drying soap with high pH levels to remove germs. What if you treated your hands and neck with the same care and attention as you do your face?

What you can do to make a change: LOVE UP YOUR HANDS AND NECK Use the same exfoliating scrub, cleanser and moisturizer on your hands and neck as you do on your face. Protect them from prolonged sun exposure, and put coconut oil on your hands. (Coconut oil has a natural sun protection element to it, makes skin feel soft and subtle, and it’s very inexpensive.

# Mistake # 7 Eating too much sugar How this ages your skin:

Experts now agree that eating processed sugar over a lifetime can lead to dull, wrinkled skin. Huh? Why would sugar speed up the aging process? Good question! A high-sugar diet reduces the quality of the collagen in your skin. How does this work? Your skin has three types of collagen (I, II, and III) and when it absorbs too much sugar, it weakens type III, which

is also the strongest and most durable collagen. This is what makes your skin look less supple, drier and more prone to wrinkles.

What you can do to make a change: SWITCH TO NATURAL UNPROCESSED SWEETENERS If the thought of foregoing sugar altogether is giving you a nervous breakdown, relax… here are a few healthier alternatives so you don’t have to forever abandon your sweet tooth:  Maple syrup that is pure, unflavored and free of additives like high- fructose corn syrup  Raw honey that is unheated and unfiltered is rich in minerals and vitamins  Black strap molasses is high in iron and Vitamin B6  Date sugar is high in fiber, calcium, potassium and magnesium  Stevia and Monk fruit are wonderful sweeteners for weight control

# Mistake # 8 Turning to supplements instead of fresh produce for antioxidants

How this ages your skin: Vitamins may not age your skin and they can be useful but they can also be expensive so they shouldn’t replace the power of fresh, organic foods that are high in antioxidants (and fiber). Antioxidants are vitamins such as beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E found in colorful fruits and veggies... especially berries. They protect us

from free radicals that cause our cells to age and can also boost collagen production to make our skin glow.

What you can do to make a change: BERRY-LY EVER AFTER! Add a handful of organic mixed berries: blueberries, strawberries, blackberries and raspberries to your breakfast or protein drink. Over time, these super foods can actually reverse skin discoloration associated with aging because they help speed up your skin’s natural repair system.

# Mistake # 9 Turning your nose up at smelly sulfur veggies

How this ages your skin: You know that stinky egg odor that rises up from mineral hot springs? That’s sulfur! And it’s actually really good for your skin. It’s the often- misunderstood “beauty mineral.” If your body lacks sulfur, your skin will look dull, your pores will clog up and your complexion will appear lackluster. Why? Sulfur provides smoothness and shine to your skin by helping with fat digestion and controlling the metabolism of carbohydrates. Sulfur also helps rid the body of waste.

And…..it resists bacteria and protects against toxicity. Additionally, it helps restore connective tissue in the skin and maintain its structural integrity.

What you can do to make a change: EAT THE STINKY VEGGIES! Think twice next time before turning your nose up at the cruciferous family of veggies in the produce section like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, turnips, bokchoy and kohlrabi. Add these to your diet and your skin will start to glow as though you’ve been soaking it up in mineral hot springs.

# Mistake # 10 How you drink your coffee, tea and wine

How this ages your look: Your eyes may be the window to your soul, but your teeth are what others see when you talk or smile. We all know that the caffeine in tea and coffee is notorious for staining your once white tooth enamel and causing it to yellow. As we age, we are more prone to stains because of the amount of caffeine or red wine we consume and because of how we sip it.

What you can do to make a change: STRAWBERRY WHITENING PASTE! Be mindful when you drink coffee, tea or red wine not to swoosh it around on your teeth like a mouthwash because it stains the teeth. Another trick is to use a natural tooth-whitener containing malic acid found in strawberry! Mash one strawberry to a pulp and mix with half a teaspoon of baking powder. Use a toothbrush to coat your teeth with the mixture. Leave on for five minutes and then brush! Now, go out and flash those pearly whites!
